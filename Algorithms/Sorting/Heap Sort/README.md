# Heap Sort: A Comprehensive Guide

Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure. It builds a max heap (or min heap) and repeatedly extracts the maximum (or minimum) element to achieve a sorted array.

## Statistics
- **Type**: Comparison-based
- **Data Structure**: Binary Heap
- **Stable**: No
- **In-place**: Yes
- **Worst Case Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
- **Best Case Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
- **Average Case Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) auxiliary

## Real-World Examples
1. **Priority Queues**: Heap Sort's underlying structure, binary heaps, is widely used to implement priority queues.
2. **Scheduling Systems**: Used for efficiently managing tasks with priority levels.
3. **Median Maintenance**: Finding the median in a stream of numbers.

---

## Basic Operations
1. **Heapify**: Adjusts a binary tree to maintain the heap property.
2. **Build-Heap**: Converts an unordered array into a heap.
3. **Heap-Extract**: Removes and returns the root (maximum or minimum).
4. **Heap-Sort**: Iteratively extracts elements to create a sorted array.

## Implementation
```python
# Heap Sort Implementation in Python
def heapify(arr, n, i):
    largest = i
    left = 2 * i + 1
    right = 2 * i + 2

    if left < n and arr[left] > arr[largest]:
        largest = left

    if right < n and arr[right] > arr[largest]:
        largest = right

    if largest != i:
        arr[i], arr[largest] = arr[largest], arr[i]
        heapify(arr, n, largest)

def heap_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)

    # Build max heap
    for i in range(n // 2 - 1, -1, -1):
        heapify(arr, n, i)

    # Extract elements from heap
    for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1):
        arr[i], arr[0] = arr[0], arr[i]  # Swap
        heapify(arr, i, 0)

# Example Usage
arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]
heap_sort(arr)
print("Sorted array:", arr)
```

## Advantages
1. **Time Complexity**: Consistent O(n log n) performance.
2. **Space Efficiency**: Requires only O(1) auxiliary space.
3. **Not Recursion-Heavy**: Suitable for systems with limited stack space.

---

## Disadvantages
1. **Not Stable**: Relative order of equal elements may change.
2. **Overhead**: Heapify operations can introduce constant overhead.
3. **Not Cache-Friendly**: Scattered memory access can affect performance.

---

## Applications
1. **Task Scheduling**: Optimal for handling priority-based tasks.
2. **Graph Algorithms**: Used in algorithms like Dijkstra's and Prim's.
3. **Data Compression**: Implements priority queues in Huffman coding.
4. **Sorting Large Data Sets**: Handles large arrays efficiently without additional memory.

## Complexity Analysis
| Case           | Time Complexity |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Best Case      | O(n log n)      |
| Worst Case     | O(n log n)      |
| Average Case   | O(n log n)      |

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
- **Auxiliary Space**: O(1)
- **Heapify Time Complexity**: O(log n)

## Summary
Heap Sort is a robust and efficient sorting algorithm suited for scenarios where in-place sorting is essential and memory is constrained. While it lacks the stability of other algorithms like Merge Sort, its consistent performance and low space requirements make it a practical choice in various applications.
