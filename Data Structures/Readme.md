### Introduction

Data structures are the fundamental building blocks of computer programming. They define how data is organized, stored, and manipulated within a program. Understanding data structures is very important for developing efficient and effective algorithms. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide to various data structures, their implementations, and their applications.

### Classification of Data Structures

### Array

An array is a collection of elements identified by index or key. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.

### Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object, known as a node. Each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

### Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It allows operations at one end only, called the top of the stack.

### Queue

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. It allows operations at both ends, called the front and rear of the queue.

### Tree

A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, with a single node as the root and sub-nodes as children. Trees are used to represent hierarchical relationships.

### Graph

A graph is a collection of nodes, called vertices, and edges that connect pairs of vertices. Graphs are used to represent networks and relationships.

### Hash Table

A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. It allows for fast data retrieval based on key values.

### Heap

A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. It is commonly used to implement priority queues.
<!-- 
### Trie

A trie is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings. It is commonly used for efficient retrieval of keys in a dataset of strings. -->
