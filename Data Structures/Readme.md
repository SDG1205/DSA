### Introduction

Data structures are the fundamental building blocks of computer programming. They define how data is organized, stored, and manipulated within a program. Understanding data structures is very important for developing efficient and effective algorithms. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide to various data structures, their implementations, and their applications.

### Linear Data Structures

Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. 

#### Types:

1. **Array**:<br/>
An array is a linear data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type. Elements are allocated contiguous memory, allowing for constant-time access. Each element is identified by a unique index number. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. It is a **Static Data Structure** as the size is primarily fixed in nature.

2. **Linked List**:<br/>
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object, known as a node. Each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, nodes of linked lists are not stored in contiguous memory locations and can only be accessed sequentially, starting from the head of list.

3. **Stack**:<br/>
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It allows operations at one end only, called the top of the stack.  Stacks play an important role in managing function calls, memory, and are widely used in algorithms, web development, and systems like compilers and browsers.

4. **Queue**:<br/>
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. It allows operations at both ends, called the front and rear of the queue. Queues play an important role in managing tasks or data in order, scheduling and message handling systems.

### Non-Linear Data Structures

Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in a single run only.

#### Types:

1. **Tree**:<br/>
A tree is a non-linear, hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges, with a single node as the root and sub-nodes as children. Trees are used to represent hierarchical relationships. They are widely used in file systems, databases, decision-making algorithms, etc.

2. **Graph**:<br/>
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and a set of edges(or links)that connect pairs of nodes. Graphs are used to represent networks and relationships between entities.

### Hash Table

A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. It allows for fast data retrieval based on key values.

---

### Heap

A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. It is commonly used to implement priority queues.

---

<!-- 
### Trie

A trie is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings. It is commonly used for efficient retrieval of keys in a dataset of strings. -->
